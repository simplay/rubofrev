# CollisionChecker Checks whether current shape movement was legal.
# If issue was present, determines what kind of issue was present.
# Collision state is stored in CollisionChecker#state.

# Detectable states:
#   + bounded: cannot move any further sidewards (left, right).
#   + grounded: either floor hit or another already placed shape.
#   + moveable: next update does not result in a collision.

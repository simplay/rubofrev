# Shape encodes a collection of dependent cells that have to be placed in the game grid,
# using provided user inputs and game state updates.
#
# This is an abstract formulation of a concrete Shape. In order to define an own shape
# Inherit from this class and implement Shape#position_states
#
# Each shape has a special position called :origin that is a unique position in the game grid.
# This position is used in the game grid.
# Note that origin is used to define the zero position of locale shape coordinate system.
# When moving a shape in the grid, only its origin position is actually moved (down, left, right).
#
# The gestalt of a shape is given by a set of Point2f instance referenced in :local_points.
# Note that these points are in local shape coordinates with zero position given by :origin.
# Therefore, by simply adding the Point2f :origin to the Point2f configuration :local_points
# gives us the points locations in the game grid.
#
# For rotating a shape we ONLY have to modify (rotate) the point set :local_points.
# Instead of implementing a discrete rotation approach, we store all supported rotational
# configurations of a shape in an list called :position_states.
#
# Whenever we apply a rotation to a shape we simply pick the corresponding rotational
# configuration from that list. Only rotations by 90 degrees are supported, thus we
# have to store/define 4 rotational configurations for each shape.
#
# We can think of Shape#position_states as a # 4x4 Local coordinate system.
#   E.g. a 3x3 system would look like this:
#
#     ============================
#     | (-1,1)  | (0,1)  | (1,1) |
#     ============================
#     | (-1,0)  | (0,0)  | (1,0) |
#     ============================
#     | (-1,-1) | (0,-1) | (1,-1)|
#     ============================
#
# Each cell in this matrix is a Point2f instance and the zero location (0,0) corresponds to :origin.
# If a specific coordinate is encoded in configuration stores in :position_states, then use that cell.
#
# Each shape has a color assigned.
